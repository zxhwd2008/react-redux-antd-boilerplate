## Potential TODOs

### Requirements

* Integrate app with Github OAuth 2.0
* Adding more filters (Filter by language, keyword etc.)
* Parse README.md on the repository details page
* 100% covered unit test

### Tech Stack

* Upgrade to Webpack V3
* Integrate with unit test coverage tools (karma-coverage)
* Integrate with Reselect to improve React & Redux performance
* Integrate with document generation tools on build process
